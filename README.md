software testing
    testing axioms
        the rule to live by, statement of truth

        you cannot test everything in every case
        your code will never we bug free, tests are not perfect
        where one bug is, more are
    testing pyramid
        unit tests
        component tests
        integreation tests
        system tests
        manual tests
    nonfunctional testing
        all the meta info
            can it be hacked
            can it be scaled
            is it fast
