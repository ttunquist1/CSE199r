daily standup
    What have I done
    What will I do

notes:

task estimation and subdivision
sylabus
basic technical knowledge

task estimation and subdivision:

Top-down
using similar past projects as a good guess

bottom-up
breaking down the project into small tasks and adding up the time

PERT method
O+4M+P -> Combines optimistic most likely and pessemistic estimates

Iron Triangle
    Scope  Time  Cost  ==> Quality

software testing
    testing axioms
        the rule to live by, statement of truth

        you cannot test everything in every case
        your code will never we bug free, tests are not perfect
        where one bug is, more are
    testing pyramid
        unit tests
        component tests
        integreation tests
        system tests
        manual tests
    nonfunctional testing
        all the meta info
            can it be hacked
            can it be scaled
            is it fast

    AI prompt engineering.
        Context
            The more you tell it, the more it will be able to help
        Specificity
            give it a detailed description
            Give it structure
            Give it Contraints
        Hints
            guide it the way you want, make it easy to know the direction
        Iteration
            Put time into it, don't one question it.

    Docker
        allows linux stuff to be cool
        can put entire program in container and share it easy
        virtual operating system on laptop, super light running and nice.
        Kubernetes: a container manager. Allow you to make multiple instances when needed.

    Environmental Variables/Shell SCripts
        Path Variable: when on command line, will look through directory you are in, and then all locations where the software might be
        Home: 
        Temp: staches temporatry files for programs

        Mac is basically Linux
        CMD is cool
        temprorary vs permanent
        temporary are for current session only
        permament are always present when app is started.
        cd ~ takes you home
        pwd is your directory

        environments are cool. you can set it to be debug or not and that will help with stuff.
